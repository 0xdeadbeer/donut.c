# donut.c 

My ~~simpler~~ version of donut.c by <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">Andy Sloane</a> and some newly coded cube.c & pyramid.c programs I coded after figuring out how donut.c works :)

I'll probably make a future video on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICp0q6JpR_9yeICzj9mBkA">Youtube channel</a> explaining the math behind it so make sure to subscribe, ty :3
