# My donut.c 

My simpler version of donut.c by <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html">Andy Sloane</a>. Was trying to understand how the program works and after about 3-4 weeks I can say I have a clear understanding of how the program works (excluding the reflection and light part for now..)

I'll probably make a future video on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICp0q6JpR_9yeICzj9mBkA">Youtube channel</a> explaining the math behind it :3
